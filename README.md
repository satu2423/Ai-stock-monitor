## Important Notes

- The Streamlit application is deployed and runs inside Snowflake using Snowflake Streamlit.
- All operational data (inventory, alerts, reorder logic) is stored and processed in Snowflake.
- This GitHub repository contains only the application source code, SQL logic, and sample data for reference.
- The application uses `get_active_session()` and is not intended to run locally without a Snowflake environment.
